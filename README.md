# PrintDiskSpace
## About
PrintDiskSpaceCLI is a simple program that outputs the disk space of any disk you select. (C:\ drive is selected by default)

There isn't 50 arguments, there isn't intense syntax you have to learn before you use it, It's simply run it via command prompt without any arguments to get the C:\ drive space â€” or add a few arguments to make the search more tailored to you.
